I plan to take this a couple steps further..  This Fork is for a hallway light setup.. 9 rows of lights down a hallway..
After basic assembly and functionality is completed, I plan to integrate an OpenMV Cam M7 to track movement and control the lighting.  
-gerber files to order a pcb were added.  
I have recieved my pcb 2018-12-03, and will assemble for testing shortly
